## Sample
The final sample consisted of `r nsubj` participants (`r n_female` female), with a mean age of `r round(mean_age, 1)` (SD = `r round(sd_age, 2)`). There were `r n_german` native German speakers and `r n_french` native French speakers. 

Participants self-reported language history using the LEAP-Q questionnaire. Participants rated themselves out of 10 on proficiency in English (0 = no proficiency, 10 = perfect proficiency). 

The mean rating for proficiency in speaking was `r round(mean_speak_L2, 2)` (SD = `r round(sd_speak_L2, 2)`), reading was `r round(mean_read_L2, 2)` (SD = `r round(sd_read_L2, 2)`) and understanding was `r round(mean_und_L2,2)` (SD = `r round(sd_und_L2, 2)`). The mean age of initial acquisition of English was 7.56, and mean age in which self-reported fluent proficiency was acquired was 12.08.

L2_bilateral <- nrow(L2_data[L2_data$L2.mean_laterality == 'bilat',])

```


## Laterality Indices
Normality was assessed using Shaprio-Wilk test. Laterality indices for L1 were found to be normally distributed (p > .05), whereas LIs for L2 were not (p = `r round(L2_normality$p.value, 2)`). 

The total mean laterality indices for L1 (French or German) were `r round(L1_mean_LI_total, 2)` (SE =  `r round(SEM_L1, 2)`)  and total mean laterality indices for L2 (English) were `r round(L2_mean_LI_total, 2)` (SE = `r round(SEM_L2, 2)`). Participants were categorised as left-lateralised if the mean asymmetry index was positive and significantly different to zero, right-lateralised if the mean asymmetry index was negative and significantly different to zero, and bilateral if the 95% confidence interval spanned zero. The mean number of trials was `r mean_trials_L2`, (max = `r max_trials_L1`, min = `r min_trials_L1`).

When calculating mean LIs, `r L1_left` participants were left lateralised for L1 and `r L1_bilateral` participants were bilaterally lateralised for L1. `r L2_left` participants were left lateralised for L2 and `r L2_bilateral` were bilaterally lateralised for L2.

When calculating the peak LIs, `r nrow(L1_data[L1_data$L1.peak_laterality == 'L',]) ` participants were left lateralised for L1 and `r nrow(L1_data[L1_data$L1.peak_laterality == 'bilat',])` participant was bilaterally lateralised for L1. `r nrow(L2_data[L2_data$L2.peak_laterality == 'L',])` participants were left lateralised for L2 and `r nrow(L2_data[L2_data$L2.peak_laterality == 'bilat',])` were bilaterally lateralised for L2.

## Correlation between L1 and L2 laterality 

The relationship between lateralisation of L1 and L2 was assessed using Spearman's rank. There was found to be a significant positive correlation between laterality of L1 and L2 (rs(23) = `r round(L1_L2_corr$estimate, 2) `, p < .001). 

## Reliability 

Reliability of tests were assessed using split half reliability. A Spearmanâ€™s rank split-half correlation was calculated comparing scores on odd and even trails. The split-half correlation was significant for L1 (rs(23) = `r round(OEcorr_mean_L1$estimate, 2)`, p = `r round(OEcorr_mean_L1$p.value, 3)`) and L2 (rs(23) = `r round (OEcorr_mean_L2$estimate, 2)`, p < .001).

## Handedness 

Handedness scores on the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory ranged from `r round(min_EHI, 2)` to `r round(max_EHI, 2)` (mean = `r round(mean_EHI, 2)`, SD = `r round(sd_EHI, 2)`). 
Spearmanâ€™s correlation founds scores on EHI were not correlated to mean LI for L1 (rs(23) = `r round(EHI_LI_L1_cor$ estimate, 2)`, p = `r round(EHI_LI_L1_cor$p.value, 3)`) or L2 (rs(23) = `r round(EHI_LI_L2_cor$ estimate, 2)`, p = `r round(EHI_LI_L2_cor$p.value, 3)`).

## Testing Order

2 Independent samples t tests were run to compare laterality scores of those who were tested in their native language first and those who were tested in their second language first. They found no significant difference in the LIs of L1 (t(`r round(testing_ttest_L1$parameter, 1)`) =  `r round (testing_ttest_L1$statistic, 2)`, p = `r round(testing_ttest_L1$p.value, 3)`) or L2 (t(`r round(testing_ttest_L2$parameter, 1)`) =  `r round (testing_ttest_L2$statistic, 2)`, p = `r round(testing_ttest_L2$p.value, 3)`) related to testing order.

## Native Language and LIs

A 2x2 mixed ANOVA was conducted to investigate the influence of native language and mean LI. There were no significant main effects for native language on L1 (F (1,23) = `r round (native_language_F,3)`, p = `r round (native_language_p,2)`) or L2 (F (1,23) = `r round (language_tested_F,3)` , p = `r round (language_tested_P,2)`). The interaction between these factors was also not significant (F (1,23) = `r round(interaction_F, 3)`, p = `r round(interaction_P,3)`).
